# CrazyStart
Want to start developing a web project but don't want to stuck in the file setup? CrazyStart is here for you. This is very simple boilerplate with most necessary files organized very simply. You can start any project with this one. 

### Another Boilerplate?
I have reviewed some boilerplates but I want a most simple start which should be easy and shouldn't have any extra content which are 'optional'. So I created my own.

CrazyStart has the most simple file structure with only necessary files with no complex directories at all. I have added jQuery  with a saperate js file "all.js" where you can directly code jQuery functions for projects. JQuery is very common and have become the soul of the front-end engineering these days. No?!

For making css consistent, I have added normlize.css in style.css and below that you can write your own styles, so you don't have to use more than 1 css files.

### When to use CrazyStart

The answer is whenever you want. But I would recommmend to use any frontend framework like Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation if you have more than couple of pages websites. CrazyStart is for most simple projects like your portfolio website, or small landing pages.
